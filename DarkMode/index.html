    <h1>Bull Terrier</h1>

    <section>
        <p>Tail wagging, egghead ipsum. Fetch a stick, chase the ball, zoomies through the yard. A gladiator spirit with a clown's heart. Snuggle on the couch, or bark at the wind. With a strong jaw and a silly grin, this is the best of days.</p>
        <p>Tug of war, chew the toy, and burrow deep under blankets. The loyalty is fierce, the mischief is plenty. Ears perked high, a mischievous glint in their eyes. This pup is a white cavalier, full of life and happy sighs.</p>
        <p>A powerful build and an agile leap, a nose for adventure while the humans sleep. Needs a walk and a mental game, always ready to repeat the same. Devotion is the game, affection is the win. Now, where is that frisbee? Let the fun begin!</p>
        <p>Bull and terrier, the original crossbreed of strength and spunk. Hinks' vision of the perfect gentleman's companion. With a powerful physique and a distinctive egg-shaped head, the White Cavalier roamed the English streets, a dapper dog for the discerning owner.</p>
